  & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 \\
\hline 2 & 4 & 8 & 16 & 32 & 64 & 128 \\
3 & 9 & 27 & 91 & 243 & & \\

Evaluate $243^\frac{4}{5}$

We will deal with the root first and then the power. Remember we prefer to make numbers smaller before we make them bigger.
Firstly we recognise $243$ as a power of $3$.
As it is in the 5<sup>th</sup> column we know that $243^{\frac{1}{5}}=3$.
Then $3^4$ is $81$.

$\therefore 243^{\frac{4}{5}}=81$
