### Explanation

There are some quantities that cannot be precisely represented as fractions or decimals, such as the number $\pi$. These are known as irrational numbers, and there are infinitely many of them!

One instance where we often encounter irrational numbers is when we take the square root of an integer that has a prime factorisation containing a prime to an odd power.

## Simplifying Surds

One thing we can do with irrational numbers is clean up as much of the surd as we can.

We do that by looking for the largest square number that is a factor of the number in the square root.

Simplify $\sqrt{20}$

$$
\begin{align*}
\sqrt{20} &= \sqrt{4 \times 5}\\
&= \sqrt{4} \times \sqrt{5}\\
&= 2 \sqrt{5}
\end{align*}
$$

Another way to look at the same example is to think about 20 in terms of it's prime factors.

$$
\begin{align*}
\sqrt{20} &= \sqrt{2^2 \times 5^1}\\
&= \left(2^2 \times 5^1 \right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\\
&= \left(2^\frac{2}{2} \times 5^\frac{1}{2} \right)\\
&= 2^1 \times 5^\frac{1}{2} \\
&= 2 \sqrt{5}
\end{align*}
$$
