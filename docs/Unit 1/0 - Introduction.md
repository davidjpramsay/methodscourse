## Content

Unit 1 contains the three topics:

- Functions and Graphs
- Trigonometric Functions
- Counting Techniques and Probability

## Functions and Graphs

In Unit 1 we cover **Function Notation**. We are then introduced to the family of functions known as **Poylnomials**, starting with **Linear Functions**, then **Quadratics**, and then **Cubics**.

## Trigonometric Functions

**Trigonometric Functions** are first defined using using the **Unit Circle**. We then define a new unit of measure for angle known as **Radians**. Finally we investigate periodic functions $f(x)=\sin{x}$, $f(x)=\cos{x}$, and $f(x)=\tan{x}$.

## Counting Techniques and Probability

In the **Probability** section of the course we formalise the notation and then use the probability laws in applied problems. We then learn some counting techniques and then apply them to different problems including binomial expansions.
