# The Unit Circle

## Introduction

The Unit Circle is a circle with radius 1 unit on the Cartesian plane centred at the origin. We then create a ray from the origin with and angle from the postive $x$-axis of $\theta$ degrees. The point of intersection of the ray and the circle will have a set of coordinates $(x,\ y)$.

We then invent some new functions, $\sin{x}$ and $\cos{x}$ that can "magically" (for now) convert the angle $\theta$ into the $y$ and $x$ coordinates respectively. While we are at it we also define a function, $\tan{x}$, that is the ratio of the first two functions.

## Definition

$$
\begin{align*}
\sin{\theta}&=y\\
\cos{\theta}&=x\\
\tan{\theta}&=\frac{\sin{\theta}}{\cos{\theta}}
\end{align*}
